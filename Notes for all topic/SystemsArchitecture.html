<h2>Architecture Of The CPU </h2>
<body>
    <p>The purpose of a CPU is to fetch, decode and execute instructions, it does this by:
        <h3>Fetch</h3>
        <ul>Fetching the next instructions from the main memory (RAM) </ul> 
        <ul>Brings the instructions back into the CPU </ul>
        
        <h3>Decode</h3>
        <ul>Checks the instruction and work out what needs to be done</ul>
        
        <h3>Execute</h3>
        <ul>Carries out the instructions</ul>
            <ul>performing calculations</ul>
            <ul>storing information back into memory</ul>

        CPU is made up from a number of components:

        ALU-Arithmetic Logic Units
        <ul> add, subtract, repeated addition (multiply), repeated subtraction (division)</ul>
        <ul>AND, OR, XOR, NOT operations</ul>
        <ul>binary shift operations</ul>
