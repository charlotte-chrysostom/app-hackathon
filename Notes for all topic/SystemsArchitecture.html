<h2>Architecture Of The CPU </h2>
<body>
    <p>The purpose of a CPU is to fetch, decode and execute instructions, it does this by:
        <h3>Fetch</h3>
        <ul>Fetching the next instructions from the main memory (RAM) </ul> 
        <ul>Brings the instructions back into the CPU </ul>
        
        <h3>Decode</h3>
        <ul>Checks the instruction and work out what needs to be done</ul>
        
        <h3>Execute</h3>
        <ul>Carries out the instructions</ul>
            <ul>Performing calculations</ul>
            <ul>Storing information back into memory</ul>
        <br>
        <h3>CPU is made up from a number of components:</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>ALU-Arithmetic Logic Units</h4>
        <ul>Add, subtract, repeated addition (multiply), repeated subtraction (division)</ul>
        <ul>AND, OR, XOR, NOT operations</ul>
        <ul>Binary shift operations</ul>
       
        <br>
        <h4>Control Unit</h4>
        <ul>Co-ordinate the activity of the CPU</ul>
        <ul>Sending out the control signals to control/synchronise how the data moves around the parts of the CPU and memory </ul>
        <ul>Decoding instructions</ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Cache Memory</h4>
        <ul>Most frequently used insructions are copied here to reduce the time needed to fetch instructions from the RAM </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Register</h4>
        <ul>Memory locations within the CPU that hold specific pieces of data temporarily and can be accessed very quickly</ul>
